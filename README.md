# Pothole-Detection-using-XAI
This repository presents a complete pipeline for detecting road potholes using deep learning models enhanced with Explainable AI techniques like GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, and SmoothGrad. The solution enables transparent classification, allowing road maintenance authorities and city planners to understand model reasoning for every prediction.
